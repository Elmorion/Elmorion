# About me

I'm an engineer who wants to become a Data Scientist

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
I began my career as an engineer in construction before deciding to pursue further education by attending engineering classes to enhance my skills in planning and design.
Currently, I am a state-certified engineer working in the architectural sector. 
My primary role involves planning and constructing windows, ranging from individual units to large-scale facades, as well as designing special constructions customized to the unique requirements of our clients.
I always wanted to work in the IT sector, but due to different reasons and decisions, I first became an engineer.
I had some IT classes in school and engineering class and I really enjoyed it a lot.
A few years ago, I heard about Data Science and it sounded very interesting, but I didn't delve further into this topic.
At the end of 2023, I delved deeper into the topics and the work of a data scientist and I could identify myself 100% with this job, so I decided to start studying Data Science at the start of 2024.
I don't have a lot of time between work and all my studies, but I will put a lot of effort and time into my new goal!
