# About me

I'm an engineer who wants to become a Data Scientist

<details>
<summary>Details</summary>
I began my career as an engineer in construction before deciding to pursue further education by attending engineering classes to enhance my skills in planning and design.
Currently, I am a state-certified engineer working in the architectural sector. 
My primary role involves planning and constructing windows, ranging from individual units to large-scale facades, as well as designing special constructions customized to the unique requirements of our clients.
I always wanted to work in the IT sector, I had IT classes in school and engineering course and I really enjoyed it a lot.
I first heard about Data Science a few years ago, and it really caught my interest.
AT the end of 2023, I decided to research more about data science and what a job in data science may involve.
I believe I have the right skills and mindset for this job. At the start of 2024, I began to study data science. 
Although I work a full time job, I am willing to put in a lot of effort to achieve my goals
